/*
 * !!!Think about controller support!!!
 * 
 * Basic Attack:
 * - Gumpistol: Shoot out your hands alternately (base on aspd) to the direction you are looking
 *
 * Heavy Attack:
 * - Gumbazooka: Shoot out both your hands in the direction you are looking (2s cooldown)
 * 
 * Attacks should be physics based and should ricochet upon collision.
 * Since attacks stretches, it should feel snappy, and have a lot of weight on impact.
